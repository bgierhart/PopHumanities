# PopHumanities

I intend for this blog to tackle pop culture with a classical approach. The blog will contain essay, articles, reviews and more on the disciplies of comics, film, theatre, literature, video games and other modern media. The singular focus will be on these different forms of modern or "pop" humanities are just modern forms of classical arts and humanities. They all come from the timeless human need to express oneself.
